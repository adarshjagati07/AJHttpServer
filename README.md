# AJHttpServer

I am going to create an HTTP webserver from scratch over here in this repository. (Note: This is not a website which runs on a server. This is a server) Network programming.

<h2>Some points for user understanding:</h2>

1.) Initially I am developing this server such that only single site can run on it. So in singleSite folder i have given a starter kit in which a developer can understand how he have to structure his files in order to get full use of our server.(for the help of developer)
