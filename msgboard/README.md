# Message Board Project

This is a basic project which is going to deal with the crud functionalities. In this project for server or backend i am going to use my own made web Server i.e., AJHttpServer.<br>

My main aim behind building this project is to test my server and find its limitations. If it is working properly or not. And according to the need I can append changes in my Server.<br>

This website is not meant for any show purpose, it also does not focus on good ui or look and feel. It is just for practice and learning purpose.<br>

This is the version 1 of my project.
